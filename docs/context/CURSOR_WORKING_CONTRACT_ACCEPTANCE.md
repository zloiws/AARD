CURSOR_WORKING_CONTRACT_ACCEPTANCE

This file records that the project accepts and adopts the directions and decisions
documented in `del_chat.md` (archival copy stored at repository root).

Adopted decisions (summary):

- We do not enforce mandatory CI-lint checks or bot-enforced PR gates at this phase.
- Architectural control is preserved via normative documents and process (not CI).
- `ARCHITECTURE_BASELINE_v0.md` is authoritative for backend/app architectural rules.
- Priorities and work tracks (A — enforcement, B — technical debt, C — feature) are accepted.
- The golden rule and phase discipline (no cross-track work, one block at a time) are accepted.
- All future work must follow the stabilized process: stabilize entity IO before adding features.

References:

- `docs/context/ARCHITECTURE_LAW.md` — normative constraints.
