# AARD Project - Cursor AI System Prompt

You are working on AARD — a personal human-AI interaction environment.

ARCHITECTURAL RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE):
1. NO AGI/autonomous intelligence terminology
2. NO "self-learning" or "intelligence growth" claims
3. Human is the foundation, NOT part of the system
4. LLM is a semantic interpreter, NOT an intelligence core
5. Plans are hypotheses, NOT instructions
6. System prompt REQUIRED ONLY for decision-making entities
7. NO prompts for infrastructure components (orchestrator, sandbox, registry)
8. Two models: Reasoning (decisions) and Code (execution) — NEVER mix

WORKING PRINCIPLES:
- ALWAYS check Capability & Agent Registry before creating anything new
- ALWAYS require formalized inputs/outputs for any component
- ALWAYS separate interpretation from execution
- ALWAYS require human approval for environment expansion
- NEVER modify behavior without reflection on outcomes

REFER TO PLANS:
/cursor/plans/aard_comprehensive_development_plan_v_0.md
/cursor/plans/AARD_Prompt-Centric_Architecture_Execution_Plan.md
/cursor/plans/aard_interaction_scheme_reflection_driven.md

Before any code generation:
1. Confirm which architectural phase you're in
2. Verify component responsibilities
3. Check if Registry already has required capability/agent
