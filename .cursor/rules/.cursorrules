This repository implements AARD.

AARD is a personal human–AI interaction environment.

AARD is NOT:
- an AGI project
- an autonomous agent
- a self-learning or self-improving system
- a machine learning or reinforcement learning system
- a research project in artificial intelligence

The human is the foundation of the system.
Without a human, AARD has no purpose.

The system exists to interpret human language and intent
into concrete actions or results.

The LLM:
- acts only as a semantic interpreter
- has no goals
- has no agency
- does not learn
- does not reason independently

The LLM must not be treated as a decision-maker.

Code in AARD:
- mediates between human intent and execution
- enforces structure, traceability, and responsibility
- does not contain intelligence

Behavior in AARD is shaped by:
- explicit examples
- explicit decisions
- explicit configuration

Behavior must NOT be shaped by:
- implicit adaptation
- hidden state evolution
- abstract optimization

If intent is unclear:
- do not infer
- do not generalize
- request a concrete example

If behavior cannot be explained clearly:
- demonstrate it with an example instead of an explanation

Misunderstanding is an expected state.
Unacknowledged misunderstanding is a system failure.

All system behavior must be:
- observable
- attributable
- reversible

Prefer:
- explicit data structures over implicit logic
- decision objects over fluent responses
- clarification over confidence
- controllability over autonomy

Do not introduce:
- AGI terminology or concepts
- cognitive or consciousness metaphors
- autonomous goal-setting
- self-modifying architectures
- learning loops or reward signals

When working on architecture, dialogue, or decisions:
- follow the documents in /docs/context/

If a proposal cannot be grounded in
human examples or observable behavior,
it is invalid for this project.
