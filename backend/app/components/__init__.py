"""
Components layer (prompt-centric).

This package provides explicit decision/interpretation components with:
- clear input/output contracts (see `contracts.py`)
- a dedicated system prompt per component (see `/prompts/components/*.system`)

At this stage these components are thin wrappers / stubs to establish boundaries
without breaking existing production flows.
